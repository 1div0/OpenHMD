=== OpenHMD ===
This project aims to provide a Free and Open Source API and drivers for immersive technology, such as head mounted displays with built in head tracking.

=== License ===
OpenHMD is released under the permissive Boost Software License (see LICENSE for more information), to make sure it can be linked and distributed with both free and non-free software. While it doesn't require contribution from the users, it is still very appriciated.

=== Supported Devices ===
  * Oculus Rift (SDK)

== Supported Platforms ===
  * Linux
  * Windows
  * Mac Os X

=== Requirements ===
  * HIDAPI
    * http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/
    * https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/

=== Compiling and Installing ===
./configure
make
sudo make install

== Cross compiling for windows using mingw ==
export PREFIX=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/ (or whatever your mingw path is)
PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --build=`gcc -dumpmachine` --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=$PREFIX
make
the library will end up in the .lib directory, you can use microsoft's lib.exe to make a .lib file for it

== Static linking on windows ==
If you're linking statically with OpenHMD using windows/mingw you have to make sure the macro OHMD_STATIC is set before including openhmd.h. In GCC this can be done by adding the compiler flag -DOHMD_STATIC, and with msvc it can be done using /DOHMD_STATIC.

Note that this is *only* if you're linking statically! If you're using the DLL then you *must not* define OHMD_STATIC. (If you're not sure then you're probably linking dynamically and won't have to worry about this).

=== Pre-built packages ===
...

=== Using OpenHMD ===
The distribution provides a number of usage examples under the examples/ subdirectory.
